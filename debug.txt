11/4:
 ..Problem: The sprites off screen are still having their x,y positions updated when off screen. 
 ..Idea: Within the update on myState0.js, as we update each group's children, we can go through each child and check its sprite positons, and remove from our group any children that don't belong!
	..*Instead of using 'spawnMultiple()', we 	will use 'createNew()', and spawn 	enemies/sprites as needed. When they are 	off screen, we will use 'destroy()' instead 	of 'kill()' because 'kill()' doesn't seem 	to really remove the object from the group 	or even stop it from updating.
	

 ..Current Debug: We will only spawn 'BasicEnemy' and on 'checkBounds()' we will 'destroy()' instead of kill and see if it breaks at all.. This test is because basicEnemy is not created by using 'spawnMultiple', it is created as needed. I want to see how the destroy effects the group and also log its y position to see if anything is updating when it shouldn't
	..*Works as should. Now we have to test for 	the lasers since those are made with 	createMultiple.

 ..I believe the lag comes in when I spawn multiple ufo's, which automatically spawnsMultiple lasers within each object




 ..*Now must fix the bug of some ufo sprites disappearing when in a formation and passing through the top right corner
	..!Fixed, but forgot exactly how.. scratch, 	changed a certain 'kill()' to 'destroy()' 	instead. The ufo was 'killed' but its 	children sprites still lived and would rain 	down lasers. But having it 'destroyed' 	removed all of its children sprites also


 ..*I have three enemy sprites to add to my game. 
	..1. A descending bomb sprite
	..2. A ufo that comes down, opens up and 	shoots energy balls at the player.
	..3. A giant ufo that drops little ufo's 	that shoots lasers.

 	..*Had a small bug when adding the 'bigufo'. It wouldn't draw to the screen until I addded it to a 'group()'. This will be strange since I only want one bigUfo at a time, but whatever. It will get its own group, spawnRate, etc.

 ..*DEBUG: Using idNum istead of sig to handle collisions
