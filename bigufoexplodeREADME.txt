BigUfoExplosion REAMDME:
	
 ..Went to "resizeimage.net" to cut the original height/width in half.
 ..Now must put it on the spritesheet, but first, I will see if this is the proper size.
	..time to debug, one hit will change the 	big ufo to the new explosion spritesheet.
	..^^Scratch that, will see how it turns out

 ..Went to "leshylabs.com/apps/sstool", loaded my sprites and saved the atlas text as a 'JSON-TP-Array'.
